## 🛠️ Self-Contained Tutorial: Building AI Agents with Reinforcement Learning

Below is a standalone tutorial to get you started with reinforcement learning. It explains the main concepts and walks through implementing a simple Q-learning agent.

```markdown
# Building AI Agents with Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for training agents to achieve goals by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns strategies that maximize cumulative reward.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with machine-learning terminology
- Python 3.6+ and `pip` installed

## Setup
1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv rl_env
   source rl_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use rl_env\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install gym numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Understanding Reinforcement Learning
In RL, an agent makes decisions in an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards. Over time, the agent learns which actions yield the highest reward.
- **Agent** – the learner or decision-maker
- **Environment** – the system the agent interacts with
- **State** – the current situation of the environment
- **Action** – a choice the agent can make
- **Reward** – feedback from the environment

## Implementing a Basic Q-Learning Agent
We will use OpenAI Gym's `FrozenLake-v1` environment, where the goal is to reach the target without falling into holes.
```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', is_slippery=False)

action_space_size = env.action_space.n
state_space_size = env.observation_space.n
q_table = np.zeros((state_space_size, action_space_size))

num_episodes = 1000
max_steps_per_episode = 100

learning_rate = 0.1
discount_rate = 0.99
exploration_rate = 1.0
max_exploration_rate = 1.0
min_exploration_rate = 0.01
exploration_decay_rate = 0.001

rewards_all_episodes = []

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    rewards_current_episode = 0

    for _ in range(max_steps_per_episode):
        # Choose action: explore or exploit
        exploration_rate_threshold = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
        if exploration_rate_threshold > exploration_rate:
            action = np.argmax(q_table[state, :])
        else:
            action = env.action_space.sample()

        new_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

        # Update Q-table
        q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] * (1 - learning_rate) + \
            learning_rate * (reward + discount_rate * np.max(q_table[new_state, :]))

        state = new_state
        rewards_current_episode += reward
        if done:
            break

    # Decay exploration rate
    exploration_rate = min_exploration_rate + \
        (max_exploration_rate - min_exploration_rate) * np.exp(-exploration_decay_rate * episode)

    rewards_all_episodes.append(rewards_current_episode)

# Evaluate performance
rewards_per_thousand = np.split(np.array(rewards_all_episodes), num_episodes/100)
print('*** Average reward per thousand episodes ***')
for idx, r in enumerate(rewards_per_thousand):
    print(f'{(idx+1)*100}: {sum(r)/100}')
```

## Visualizing Results
Plotting the rewards helps track training progress:
```python
plt.plot(range(len(rewards_all_episodes)), rewards_all_episodes)
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Reward')
plt.title('Training Progress')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion
You have implemented a Q-learning agent. This foundation allows you to explore advanced algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks and Policy Gradient methods.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with other Gym environments
- Use Stable Baselines3 to try algorithms like DQN or PPO
- Dive into deep reinforcement learning to handle complex state spaces
